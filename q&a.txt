Write a function named doubleIt() that takes in a number and returns twice the amount.

def doubleIt(n):
	return n*2

Write a function named plusTen() that takes in a number and adds 10 to it. However it MUST use a for loop.

def plusTen(n):
	res = n
	for i in range(10):
		res += 1
	return res

Write a function named minusFive() that takes a number and subtracts it by 1 five times. It must use a while loop. 

def minusFive(n):
	res = n
	while res != (n - 5):
		res -= 1
	return res

Write a function divisibleByFive() to check whether a number is divisible by 5 or not. If it is divisible by 5 print 1. If not, print 0.

def divisibleByFive(n):
	if n % 5 == 0:
		return 1
	else:
		return 0

Write a function called findLength() to find the length of a string.

def findLength(s):
	return len(s)

Write a function named plusFive() that takes in a number and adds 5 to it. However it MUST use a for loop.

def plusFive(n):
	res = n
	for i in range(5):
		res += 1
	return res

Write a function tripleIt() that takes one parameter n and returns three times that number.

def tripleIt(n):
	return n*3

Write a function called quadrupleIt() that takes in a number and returns four times the amount.

def quadrupleIt(n):
	return n*4

Write a function named divideFive() that takes in a number that is a multiple of five and divides by five recursively until 1 is returned. You must use recursion.

def divideFive(n):
	if n % 5 == 0:
		return 1
	else:
		res = n / 5
		divideFive(res)

Write a function named operation() that takes three arguments op, a & b and returns the result of the two numbers corresponding to the operation.

def operation(op,a,b):
	if op == "+":
		return a + b
	if op == "-":
		return a - b
	if op == "*":
		return a * b
	if op == "/":
		return a / b

Write a function named factorial() that takes in a number and returns its factorial. You MUST use recursion.

def factorial(n):
	if n == 0:
		return 1
	else:
		return n*factorial(n-1)

Constraints test:
10, 20, 10, 30, 30 pts respectively
get everything right except function names for #3 and #5
